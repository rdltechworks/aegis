The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is designed for flexibility, allowing you to integrate various Large Language Models (LLMs) into your agents. While the setup for Google Gemini models is covered in the Setup Foundation Models guide, this page details how to leverage Gemini effectively and integrate other popular models, including those hosted externally or running locally.

ADK primarily uses two mechanisms for model integration:

Direct String / Registry: For models tightly integrated with Google Cloud (like Gemini models accessed via Google AI Studio or Vertex AI) or models hosted on Vertex AI endpoints. You typically provide the model name or endpoint resource string directly to the LlmAgent. ADK's internal registry resolves this string to the appropriate backend client, often utilizing the google-genai library.
Wrapper Classes: For broader compatibility, especially with models outside the Google ecosystem or those requiring specific client configurations (like models accessed via LiteLLM). You instantiate a specific wrapper class (e.g., LiteLlm) and pass this object as the model parameter to your LlmAgent.
The following sections guide you through using these methods based on your needs.
